# StayGo App

## Description
This is a service, which will help our customers to find a proper bar in city Minsk.

## Requirements
As user I want to be able to find a bar. When I want to visit a bar I usually check it's rating, type and average paycheck. Sometimes I don't remember bars name, but remember location, so I want to find bar based on it's location on the map. Also it's always nice to see some photos of the bar. Once I'v chosen the bar, I want to view its details
